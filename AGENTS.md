# CNV_BitNet2B_Model

BitNet b1.58 2B4T served over HTTP, behind the shared model-service admin page, tokens and settings. Port 29201, env prefix `SERVICE_`, token prefix `bitnet_`.

## Agent instructions
This file is the one instruction file for every coding agent; `CLAUDE.md` only imports it (`@AGENTS.md`). Edit this file, never `CLAUDE.md`.

## Commands (from this folder, venv `.venv`, managed by uv)
- Install: `uv sync` (`winget install astral-sh.uv` if uv is missing)
- Test: `uv run pytest -q`. `tests/test_admin_ui.py` needs Playwright and its browser and is skipped without it. On Windows, if uv fails with "cannot move the file to a different disk drive", set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to a folder on the same drive and `UV_LINK_MODE=copy`.
- Run: `run.bat run`, or `uv run python src/app.py` (add `--dotenv` to load `.env.local` and `.env`), or `docker compose --env-file .env.compose up -d --build`

## Rules
- Load downloaded weights only. No startup, warm-up or request downloads; missing weights return 503 with an admin Updates Download hint. Only the Updates download callback may fetch weights.
- Follow the `model-service-parity` skill and `AI/ModelServices/_docs/SHARED-FEATURES.md` (what must match in every model service) and `AI/ModelServices/_docs/SERVICE-SPECIFIC.md` (what differs on purpose). A change to a shared feature goes to every service; a new difference goes into `SERVICE-SPECIFIC.md` in the same change.
- `web/index.html`, `src/tokens.py`, `src/settings.py`, `src/updates.py` and `.dockerignore` are copies shared with the other model services. Change one, copy it to the others, run `python tools/check_sync.py` in each repo.
- `POST /v1/chat` refuses `tools`, `schema` and `thinking` with 422. This is the source of the engine shape that CNV_LFM3_Model and CNV_SparkX26_Model copy: a change to one of the three usually belongs in all three (except `tools`, which LFM3 and SparkX26 pass to Ollama and BitNet refuses).
- Settings `model`, `dtype`, `max_project_models` and `project_models_dir`; `src/cache.py` is a copy shared with Laya, MiniCPM, LFM3 and SparkX26.
- Engines: `src/engine.py` (`transformers`, default) and `src/cpp.py` (`bitnet.cpp`: a `llama-server` child process, built in the Dockerfile `cpp` stage from a pinned microsoft/BitNet commit; Docker image only). `engine` is a restart setting; with it the Updates card uses `engine.repo` (the GGUF repo), `has_project` is false and a thread change drops the server.
- Variants: `src/variants.py` lists the `dtype` formats (`bfloat16`, `float32`) of the one set of weights with the memory figures from the README (not measured), `src/hardware.py` reads RAM and the GPU (the same file as in STT_Whisper_Model). `/admin/variant` saves `dtype`, a restart setting; the base model and project models are never changed.
- Behaviour changes update `README.md`, `deployment.md`, `docs/guide-web-ui.md`, `.env.example` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same commit.
- Never read or print `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.compose`, `tokens.json` or `settings.json`.
- Commit with the noreply author email `214214011+scutiii2@users.noreply.github.com` (another address is rejected on push). Push `main`, then run `python tools/publish_live.py`. Build Docker only when the Dockerfile or the dependencies changed.
